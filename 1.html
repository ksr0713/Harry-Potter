<p>Mr. and Mrs.Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. THey were the last people you'd expect to be in-volved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.</p> Mr.Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a very big, beefy man with hardly any neck, al-though he did have a very large mustache. Mrs.Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so vuch of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
